I want to create a personal website using html and css. The first step is to set up the pages. I want a Homepage (index.html), About Me (about.html), Resume (resume.html), Projects (projects.html), Contact (contact.html). Set these up with proper html formatting.

Also set up a css styles file, and connect it to all of the html pages

Before I get into the content of these pages, I want to do some preparation for formatting and theme. I want the overall color theme and style of my website to be very professional and a neutral yet modern blue/gray theme. Also, ensure consistent fonts, colors, and layout across pages and make the site responsive so it works on desktop and mobile.

Yes, I would like a dark mode toggle and the implementation of a refined color scale.
 - Added theme.js
